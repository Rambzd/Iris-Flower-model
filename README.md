## Introduction

The Iris Flower Model project is designed to provide a clear example of building and evaluating a machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn. It uses the well-known Iris flower dataset, which contains measurements of Iris flowers from three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). The goal is to classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on their features.

This README serves as a guide to understanding the project's structure, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
iris-flower-model/
│
├── iris_flower_model/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── ... (source code files)
│
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
├── poetry.lock
└── ... (other project files)
```

- `iris_flower_model/`: Contains the source code for the machine learning model and related functionalities.
- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the project.
- `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`: Poetry configuration files to manage project dependencies and metadata.
